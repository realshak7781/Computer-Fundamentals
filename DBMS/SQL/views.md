# üìö Database Views in SQL

A **view** in SQL is a virtual table that presents data from one or more tables through an SQL query. Unlike physical tables, views do not store data themselves but display data stored in other tables. This abstraction allows users to simplify complex queries, enhance security, and present data in a specific format.

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating a View

To create a view, use the `CREATE VIEW` statement:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';
```

This view, named `EmployeeView`, displays the `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Department` columns from the `Employees` table for employees in the 'Sales' department.

## üîÑ Updating a View

Views can be updated using the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statement:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';
```

This updates the `EmployeeView` to include the `Salary` column.

## ‚ùå Dropping a View

To remove a view, use the `DROP VIEW` statement:

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
DROP VIEW EmployeeView;
```

This command deletes the `EmployeeView` from the database.

## üõ°Ô∏è Advantages of Using Views

- **Simplified Querying:** Views allow users to save complex queries and reuse them, making data retrieval more straightforward.
- **Enhanced Security:** By restricting access to specific columns or rows, views can limit user access to sensitive data.
- **Data Abstraction:** Views provide a layer of abstraction, presenting data in a specific format without exposing the underlying table structures.
- **Consistency:** Views can present a consistent, unchanging interface to the data, even if the underlying table structures change.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

- **Performance:** While views simplify querying, they can impact performance, especially if they involve complex joins or aggregations.
- **Updatability:** Not all views are updatable. For a view to be updatable, it must meet certain criteria, such as not containing aggregate functions, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING, UNION, or subqueries in the SELECT clause.
- **Dependency Management:** Dropping or altering underlying tables can affect views. It's essential to manage dependencies carefully to maintain database integrity.
