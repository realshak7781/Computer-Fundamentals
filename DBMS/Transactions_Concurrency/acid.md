The ACID properties are fundamental principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. Each letter in "ACID" stands for a specific property:

1. **Atomicity** 🧩
   - Ensures that each transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. This means that either all operations within the transaction are executed successfully, or none are applied. For example, in a bank transfer, both the debit and credit operations must succeed together; if one fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to maintain consistency.

2. **Consistency** ⚖️
   - Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, adhering to all predefined rules and constraints. This ensures that any data written to the database is valid and maintains the integrity of the database. For instance, if a database rule requires that the sum of two account balances must always equal a specific amount, any transaction must uphold this rule both before and after its execution.

3. **Isolation** 🚧
   - Ensures that transactions occurring concurrently do not interfere with each other. The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions, preventing them from accessing data being modified by another transaction until it's complete. For example, if two transactions are updating the same set of data simultaneously, isolation ensures that one transaction's operations are not visible to the other until they are finalized.

4. **Durability** 🛡️
   - Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure. This means that the results of a completed transaction are permanently recorded in non-volatile memory. For example, after a successful bank transfer, the updated account balances remain intact even if the system crashes immediately afterward.

These properties collectively ensure that database transactions are processed reliably, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
