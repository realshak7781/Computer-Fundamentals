In database management systems (DBMS), **isolation levels** determine how transaction integrity is maintained in the presence of concurrent operations. They balance data consistency and system performance by defining the extent to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in other transactions.

## Isolation Levels in DBMS

1. **Read Uncommitted** 🕶️
   - *Description*: The lowest isolation level, where transactions can read data modified by other transactions that have not yet been committed.
   - *Possible Issues*: Allows **dirty reads**, leading to potential inconsistencies.

2. **Read Committed** 📖
   - *Description*: Ensures that any data read is committed at the moment it is read. Transactions cannot read data that is being modified by other uncommitted transactions.
   - *Possible Issues*: Prevents dirty reads but may still encounter **non-repeatable reads**.

3. **Repeatable Read** 🔄
   - *Description*: Guarantees that if a transaction reads a row, subsequent reads of that row will return the same data, even if other transactions modify it.
   - *Possible Issues*: Prevents non-repeatable reads but can still face **phantom reads**.

4. **Serializable** 🛡️
   - *Description*: The highest isolation level, where transactions are completely isolated from one another, ensuring serial execution.
   - *Possible Issues*: Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads but can significantly impact performance due to reduced concurrency.

## Phenomena in Transaction Isolation

- **Dirty Read** 🧹: Occurs when a transaction reads data written by another transaction that has not yet been committed.

- **Non-Repeatable Read** 🔁: Happens when a transaction reads the same row twice and gets different values because another transaction modified the row between the two reads.

- **Phantom Read** 👻: Arises when a transaction re-executes a query returning a set of rows that satisfy a condition and finds that the set of rows satisfying the condition has changed due to another recently committed transaction.

Understanding these isolation levels and phenomena is crucial for designing robust and efficient database applications that maintain data integrity while optimizing performance.
